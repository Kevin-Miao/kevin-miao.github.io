# Coursework

<!-- Access to academic projects: [Projects](/pj) -->

<!-- Sequence   | Result                                                        |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `a?c`       | Matches `abc`, `axc`, and `aac`. Does not match `ac`, `abbc`, |
|             | or `a/c`.                                                     |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `a*c`       | Matches "ac", "abc" and "azzzzzzzc". Does not match "a/c".    |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `foo...bar` | Matches "foobar", "fooxbar", and "fooz/blaz/rebar". Does not  |
|             | match "fo/obar", "fobar" or "food/bark".                      |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `....obj`   | Matches all files anywhere in the current hierarchy that end  |
|             | in ".obj". Note that the first three periods are interpreted  |
|             | as "...", and the fourth one is interpreted as a literal "."  |
|             | character.                                                    |
